String APIs



String  is  a class:


String: Sequence of characters , enclosed with in double quotes
Ex:  "hello" , "abc123" , "ABCabc" , "1234" , "@#$%&*("

In  C-Language  , string is represented as char[]  array.

In Java we have a class known as String  to handle string values.


class Object{

	toString() --->return hashcode
	equals()  ---> compare hashcode/reference of two objects


}


class  String  extends Object{

	toString() ---> return string value
	equals()  --->  compare data / values

}

Note: to compare hashcodes of two string objects we can use == opertor.



String :

methods 
1. concat()
2. equals()
3. upperCase()
4. lowerCase()
5. length()
6. toString()
7.  compareTo()


String objects can be created in 2 different ways:


1.  Using literals

	String  s1 =  "hello";

	String  s2 =  "hello";

	String  s3  = "hello";

2.  Using new Operator

	String   str1  = new String("java");
	String   str2  = new String("java");


Note: String objects are Immutable in nature (which cannot be change or modify)





In real time when ever we want to work with string values which need to be modify frequently then we use
StringBuffer or StringBuilder  classes.

Because both to them are Mutable in nature.

StringBuilder and StringBuffer

methods:
append()
reverse()
replace()
length()
capacity()
insert()
delete()

Note: StringBuffer is ThreadSafe
