OOPs:

1. Inheritance:

In Java  one class can extends another class to access properties and achieve reusability of code.
Java classes supports only single inheritance or multi-level inheritance.
Child class/Sub class can inherite properties from parent/super class but  super class cannot inherite properties from child class.

In Java one interface can extends another interface. 
Interfaces support multiple as well as multi-level inheritance.

class A{  // super class


}

class B extends A { // here B is subclass/child class


}



----------------------

interface I1 {


}

interface I2 {


}

interface I3 extends I1 , I2{ // multiple inheritance


}



Polymorphism:(Many Forms)
When One Entity Behaving differently in different scenarios this concept is known as Polymorphism


String --> class

String  s1;

Types of Polymorphism:
-----------------------
1.CompileTime / Static Polymorphism

Ex: Operator Overloading, Method Overloading , Constructor Overloading


2. Runtime / Dynamic Polymorphism
Whenever inheritance is used in Java , runtime polymorphism is possible.

Ex: method overriding , super class reference holding child class object 

Object o = new Object();
	 = new Parent();
	 = new Child();
