Arrays:
-------
Collection of similar types of elements.

 int  arr[] = {101,102,103,104,105};


 arr[] = {101,4.5,"javeed"}; // invalid

	int  a1[] = new int[10000];  // 40,000 bytes


Limitations:
-> Array size cannot be increase or decrease at runtime its always fixed.
-> Arrays allows only homogenous elements but not heterogenous elements
-> Type casting is also difficult.



Collections 
java.util.*;
In Java collections are container objects which can be used to store homogenous or heterogenous elements/objects.
->Collections  size can be dynamically increase at runtime.
-> All collections in java uses different data structures.


Examples:  List,Set,Map,Tree,Hashtable 


List:
In Java List is a collection introduce to store  duplicate elements which can same or different.




java.util.*;


interface  Collection{

	// abstract methods  10

}

interface  List  extends  Collection{

	//abstract methods  5

}


public class ArrayList  implements  List{

	//  implemeted methods are 15



}



	List<String>   list = new ArrayList<String>();
